# ember-responsive [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/freshbooks/ember-responsive.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/freshbooks/ember-responsive) [![Ember Observer Score](http://emberobserver.com/badges/ember-responsive.svg)](http://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-responsive)

ember-responsive is an ember-cli addon that give you a simple, Ember-aware way
of dealing with media queries.

All you need to do is tell it your application's breakpoints and it'll expose the rest for you.
[Here is an interactive demo](https://www.justinbull.ca/ember-responsive-demo/)

## Requirements

ember-responsive needs [window.matchMedia()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.matchMedia)
to function, which isn't available in all browsers. [Compatibility matrix](http://caniuse.com/#feat=matchmedia)

There is a polyfill by Paul Irish called [matchMedia.js](https://github.com/paulirish/matchMedia.js)
that will add support to older browsers

## Getting Started

This is an ember-cli addon so, so all you need to do is

`ember install ember-responsive`

After that, simply register the breakpoints that are pertinent to your application in `app/breakpoints.js`:

```js
export default {
  mobile:  '(max-width: 767px)',
  tablet:  '(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991px)',
  desktop: '(min-width: 992px) and (max-width: 1200px)',
  jumbo:   '(min-width: 1201px)'
};
```

This default config has already been provided for you. If you wish to change the values or add new ones,
simply create a new `app/breakpoints.js` in your project and export your chosen config.

Now you can inject the _media_ service in any object with access to the container:

```js
import Component from '@ember/component';
import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';

export default Controller.extend({
  responsive: service(),
  doSomething() {
    this.get('media.isMobile'); // => true
  }
});
```

In your templates you have access to the `media` helper that allows you to query breakpoints easily.

```hbs
{{#if (responsive 'isDesktop')}}
  Desktop view!
{{/if}}
```

You can also bind the list of active media queries to your app's
rootElement. This means you won't have to deal with complicated media
queries in CSS, instead simply use classes to style the different devices.

In your application.hbs template:

```hbs
<div class="{{responsive 'classNames'}}">
  {{outlet}}
</div>
```

### Injection

If you find explicitly injecting the service too repetitive, you can setup an initializer to inject it automatically in every controller and component like this:

```js
// in app/initializers/ember-responsive
export default {
  name: 'responsive',
  initialize(application) {
    application.inject('controller', 'responsive', 'service:responsive');
    application.inject('component', 'responsive', 'service:responsive');
  }
};
```

### Additional Media Queries

Media queries beyond those based on size will also work in your `breakpoints.js` file, including:

```
  portrait: '(orientation: portrait)',
  landscape: '(orientation: landscape)',
  dark: '(prefers-color-scheme: dark)',
  light: '(prefers-color-scheme: light)'
```

## Updating to 2.x

When updating this addon, make sure to run the generate command. Choose `no` to overriding existing files, unless you want the defaults. This command has to be run when updating to 2.x if your application relies on automatic injection. Because as of version 1.2.9, the addon will generate an initializer to allow users to customize injection.

`ember g ember-responsive`

## Updating to 3.x

The major breaking changes to update to 3.x are so far:
- Test helpers are now all covered by `setBreakpoint`
- Calling media breakpoints in templates is now done with a helper. `{{media.isDesktop}}` -> `{{media 'isDesktop'}}`
- Tests run into issues if you have not ported to the new style tests (https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0232-simplify-qunit-testing-api.md)

## Usage in engines

If you are using engines and you want to share responsive behaviour between the main application and engine, you must pass the 'media' service to the engine app.

## Testing Helpers
This project provides a single test helper which works in both integration and acceptance tests to assist in testing
content specific to different breakpoints.

### Acceptance Tests
```javascript
...
import { setBreakpoint } from 'ember-responsive/test-support';

...

test('example test', function(assert) {
  setBreakpoint('mobile');
  visit('/');

  andThen(function() {
    // assert something specific to mobile
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests
```javascript
...
import { setBreakpoint } from 'ember-responsive/test-support';

...

test('it renders', function(assert) {
  setBreakpoint('mobile');

  this.render(hbs`{{your-component}}`);

  // assert something specific to mobile
});
```

### Multiple Breakpoints in Tests

You can set multiple breakpoints to the helper.  This is useful if your `breakpoints.js` file defines breakpoints
that overlap.

```javascript
// in app/breakpoints.js
export default {
  tablet:  '(min-width: 768px)',
  desktop: '(min-width: 992px)',
  jumbo:   '(min-width: 1201px)'
};

// in test file
...
import { setBreakpoint } from 'ember-responsive/test-support';

...

test('it renders', function(assert) {
  setBreakpoint(['tablet', 'desktop']);

  this.render(hbs`{{your-component}}`);

  // assert something specific to desktop, i.e. sizes 992px - 1201px
  // `isTablet` and `isDesktop` will both return true
});
```

## Tests

To run the tests, after cloning do:

```sh
npm install
bower install
npm test
```
